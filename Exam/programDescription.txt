orderList

Purpose
The purpose of this program is to be able to order pre-made lists by ascii code and to be able to store the ordered list without losing it after the program has stopped running.

Usage
Have a text file in the same directory as the program is running in containing a list where the elements are separated by whitespaces (spaces, newlines, etc.), however, the cannot be an empty line between elements.
The program will request the name of the file so that it may order it by ascii code, make sure to include the suffix (e.g. txt).
It will also request the name of the output file with the results of ordering it.
A file will appear in the directory containing the ordered version of the original file, with the name given by the user.

Examples of Use
Ordering a list of countries alphabetically
Organising a csv file if for example the first element is an id number

Pseudo-Code
describeProgram - 	Prints the purpose of the program for the user to understand
fileNaming -  		The user is asked the name of the input file
					The user is asked the name of the output file
extractContent -  	Takes in all the elements and stops when a line has no elements
					Closes the file
					Returns the length of the file, found by getiing the element number of the first empty line
sortList -  		Goes through the elements in the list and checks if an element is greater than the next, if it is it switches the elements
					If the characters are the same it will use recursion to order the two elements by the first differing character
outputFile -  		Creates a new file named by the user
					The ordered list is placed into the file

Special Solutions
I use recursion in order to order elements that have the first character in common.
I used arrays as inputs in order to be able to return arrays.
I define arrays larger than contents of files in order to be able to statically allocate memory and account for most lengths of lists.
